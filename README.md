Module 7 Coursework

## Directions

Module Goal
In this module, you'll create a guided project. There is no specification - we introduce some topics including machine learning as we work through the module. The project will include Jupyter. 

In this assignment, we start by creating a new project in GitHub (for storing and sharing) and on our machine (so we can use our tools). 

We will need external packages, so we will also create and manage a local project virtual environment. Assume you'll need at least these packages to get started (you may need to install more as you go). 

jupyterlab
numpy
pandas
pyarrow
matplotlib
seaborn
scipy
